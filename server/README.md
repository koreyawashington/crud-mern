# crud-mern

# Introduction
I created a FullStack MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React, and Node JS) note taking app all while using CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations. I actually started off my project with a food ordering app but unfortunately I did not know that the tutorial did not include crud operations so two days into my project I made the wise decision to start over with a new amd more simple project that will meet all of the deliverable requirements to pass y final project for school.

I created an express server which communicates with the MongoDB database.I used postman to communicates with the express server that will communicate with the MongoDB database. I then created a REACT app which will then communicate with the express server via AJAX request sent from react to the server.
