# FINAL PROJECT FOR PER SCHOLAS
# crud-mern

# Introduction
I created a FullStack MERN (MongoDB, Express JS, React, and Node JS) note taking app all while using CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations. I actually started off my project with a food ordering app but unfortunately I did not know that the tutorial did not include crud operations so two days into my project I made the wise decision to start over with a new amd more simple project that will meet all of the deliverable requirements to pass y final project for school.

I created an express server which communicates with the MongoDB database.I used postman to communicates with the express server that will communicate with the MongoDB database. I then created a REACT app which will then communicate with the express server via AJAX request sent from react to the server.

I refactored my application to make my application easy to read and navigate through. I implied all of the knowledge I learned so far and I also learned many new skills while in creation of this application. I believe one of the most important skills I learned is how to fix errors by simply making sure the files that i have changed are completely saved even if I have auto save setting on my visual studio code. I also learned to fix many errors by simply stopping the terminal and reopening the terminal back up again. I have not quite understood why this is happening yet but once I checked for errors in my code and confirm that I have no errors, I stop my terminals and restart them against and all of my work appears on the screen.

 I worked alone for most of the project and I received help some help but it was not enough to successfully fix my errors on my page. I tried my best and I bodied my time in school and learned. The most important thing that I taught myself I learned upon completion of this Co-Hort at Per Scholas is that I should learn how to solo code and build Robots and AI soon.

# Unsolved Problems
The first unsolved problem that I have when starting this project is that I originally wanted to make a mernstack crud food ordering app. I styled my app and added most of the backend until I realized that the tutorial for that code is actually not using crud operations which is a requirement for my final grade. So the first unsolved problem I have is how to add crud to my original app. so I created this note app to help me practice my coding skills so one day I can make my own crud mernstack pizza delivery app and more. 

I am currently getting having an issue with my post man connectivity to my note web applications. My connectivity for my notes was working fine but for my crud operations though. I also am having useEffect related issues in my in my notesapp/src/pages/LogoutPage.js.

I also have not fully figured out how to deploy my application but I believe in myself and I know I can do it! I had fun creating this project. 

I am also having connection issues and it is affecting my connectivity for my request from postman


# Future Enhancements
For my future enhancements I would like to transform this Note web application into a Diary entry form and add more security and admin setting to the app. I would also like to style my app a little more and hope to add more features like a photo for each account and
